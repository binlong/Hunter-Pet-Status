# Hunter Pet Status
 This addon is specifically for BM and Survival Hunters. If in the future that it needs to be updated for Marksman then I will make those changes
 
<p>Hunter Pet Status simply tracks to see if your pet is summoned in Dungeons or Raids instance.</p>
<p>The addon shows an appropriate icon when you don't have active pet summoned.</p>
<p>The icon will automatically disappear once an active pet has been summoned or revived.</p>
<p>If you don't want to summon the pet and just wants to hide the icon, you can simply click on the icon and the icon will no longer visible.</p>
