# Hunter Pet Status
 This addon is specifically for BM Hunters. If in the future that it needs to be updated for all hunters then I will make those changes.
 
<p>Hunter Pet Status simply tracks to see if your pet is summoned in Dungeons or Raids instance.</p>
<p>If your pet is not summoned then it will display the `Call Pet` icon in middle of your screen.</p>
<p>If your pet is dead then it will display the `Revive Pet` icon in middle of your screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The icon automatically goes away once you have an active pet summoned.</p>
<p>If you don't want to summon the pet and just wants to hide the icon, you can simply click on the icon and the icon will no longer visible.</p>
