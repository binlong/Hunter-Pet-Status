# Hunter Pet Status
 Tracks if pet is summoned in Raid/Dungeons


<p>Hunter Pet Status simply tracks to see if your pet is summoned in Dungeons or Raids instance.</p>
<p>If your pet is not summoned then it will display the `Call Pet` icon in middle of your screen.</p>
<p>If your pet is dead then it will display the `Revive Pet` icon in middle of your screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The icon automatically goes away once you have an active pet summoned.</p>
<p>If you don't want to summon the pet and just want the icon to go away, you can simply click on the icon and it goes away.</p>
